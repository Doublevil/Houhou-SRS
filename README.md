##Required external resources
To be able to compile everything, you will need some resources that are not part of the repository for multiple reasons (too heavy, no need for version history).
Here is a comprehensive list of these resources, along with an explanation of how to get them:
- Kanji.DatabaseMaker/Resources/**JMdict.xml**
   [Download the file from the edrdg website](http://ftp.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/JMdict.gz) and rename it.
- Kanji.DatabaseMaker/Resources/**kanjidic2.xml**
   [Download the file from the project's website](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic2/kanjidic2.xml.gz) and rename it.
- Kanji.Interface/Data/**KanjiDatabase.sqlite**
   This file is generated by the Kanji.DatabaseMaker project. Run that project and copy the output database, or [download the file from Dropbox](https://db.tt/YiZkOLko).
